# Beeline: Measuring and Minimizing Interaction Friction

> **🚧 Coming Soon!** This project is currently under development as part of the NGI Zero Commons Fund initiative.

## Project Overview

**Beeline** is an open-source framework designed to measure and minimize "conversational friction" in Large Language Models (LLMs). Rather than focusing solely on model accuracy, Beeline quantifies the effort required to reach user satisfaction, creating a more realistic measure of AI efficiency.

Currently, users waste significant time and computation refining prompts to get satisfactory results from LLMs. Beeline addresses this fundamental problem with a comprehensive four-part solution.

## Our Solution

### 1. Metric (I2R)
**Interaction-to-Resolution (I2R)** quantifies the effort (turns, time, tokens) required to reach user satisfaction, rather than just model accuracy.

### 2. Benchmark
An automated test suite hosted on sovereign European infrastructure to rank open-source models by their I2R efficiency.

### 3. Middleware
A proactive, open-source middleware layer that analyzes ambiguity and asks targeted clarifying questions before generating heavy responses.

### 4. Conversation Tree Navigation
A hierarchical tree-based interface allowing users to navigate past conversation points, branch into parallel exploration threads, and selectively carry forward only the most relevant concepts to the main conversation flow.

## Key Features

- **Beyond Static Accuracy**: Measures the "journey" - the human effort required, which is the real cost driver in adoption
- **Proactive vs. Reactive**: Introduces proactivity to general-purpose LLMs by detecting ambiguity before generation
- **Open Infrastructure**: Fully open-source toolchain on sovereign European infrastructure
- **Tree-Based Navigation**: Enables hierarchical navigation, allowing users to explore concepts in parallel branches while maintaining a clean, focused context

## Expected Outcomes

1. **I2R Metric Definition**: A standardized way to measure interaction efficiency in LLM conversations
2. **Public Leaderboard**: A transparent ranking system for model efficiency hosted on European infrastructure
3. **Middleware Library**: Open-source tools for developers to reduce friction in their AI applications
4. **Tree-Based Navigation Interface**: A hierarchical conversation navigation system enabling parallel exploration and selective context management
